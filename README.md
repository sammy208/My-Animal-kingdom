 My-Animal-kingdom

#My Animal kingdom
    Here's the Kingdom Animalia task for week 4 The Animal class is the base abstract class representing generic animal characteristics. I gave it properties for blood temperature and the presence of a vertebral column. My subclasses include:

#Arthropoda:
     Represents poikilothermic animals without a backbone, such as insects and spiders. I wanted to put in all the others but they weren't part of the diagram so here we are.

#Pisces:
     Examples include sharks and dolphins

#Amphibia:
     Examples include frogs and salamanders.

#Reptilia:
     Examples include snakes and turtles.

#Aves (Birds):
     Examples include storks and hawks

#Mammalia:
    Examples include pigs and goats
